## Description

Flap.AI was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features:
- **Dynamic Obstacles:** Pipes spawn more frequently with varied heights to keep the challenge on edge.
- **Enhanced Visuals:** Animated clouds with soft shadows provide a richer background, and the bird is rendered with detailed pixel art and animated wings.
- **Sound & Effects:** Simple beeps accompany flaps, scoring, and star pickups.
- **Collectible Stars:** Periodic stars add bonus points and incentive to explore the screen.
- **Pause/Resume:** Press `P` to pause the action at any time.
- **Unlockable Skin:** Reach 20 points to give the bird a new color palette.
- **Responsive Design:** The game scales across devices for an optimal playing experience.

This project was developed with creative input from **Grok**, **Trae** and assistance from **GPT**, blending human ingenuity with advanced language model suggestions to create a fun, browser-based game.
